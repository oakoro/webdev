Flex display ignores default displays. It automatically display items inline. Width depends on content.Flex will normally create 100% full width.
default display values:
<div> - Block
span - inline

You can set display: inline-flex. Meaning, flex takes as much space inline but other elements can also be added

Flex direction:
default = rows (left - right) 
    = Main axis is horizontal
    = Cross axis is vertical (top - bottom)

Flex direction = Column => items flow from top to bottom
    = Main axis is vertical
    = Cross axis is horizontal

Flex-basis === Height/width. Goes on child items
    For rows = width is affected
    For columns = height is affected
    Flexing along the axis
