Bootstrap Layout
12 Column System: 3 components
*Div that has a class of container - starting point
*Inside container div, is a another div with class row
*Inside the row we have the items layed out using the column System

Code:
<div> class="container">
    <div class=" row">
        <div class="col">Hello</div>
    </div>
</div>

Each row has 12 columns

Bootstrap container allocate different size on different screens
different breakpoint:
Extra snall, small, medium, large, x-large, <xx-large></xx-large>
.container, container-sm, container-md, container-lg, container-xl, container-xxl, <container-fluid></container-fluid>
sizes refers to width of the view point - horizontal width

container-fluid - on all screen size use 100% view point - edge to edge
mostly used - .container and container-fluid

class can be called col-2, col-4, col-6 etc
col-2 = use 2 columns
col-4 = use 4 columns
col-6 = use 6 columns

predefined breakpoint based on common screen sizes
breakpoint      Class infix     Dimensions
extra-small     None            <576px
small           sm              >=576px - Mobile
medium          md              >=768px - ipad
large           lg              >=992px - laptop
x-large         xl              >=1200px - desktop
xx-large        xxl             >=1400px - TV etc


example
col-sm-2 for screen greater than 576px dimension (576px - 768px)

@media query is not required

col-sm-2    col-sm-4   col-sm-6 
=> on small screen and above dim will be 2,4,and 6 but on smaller screen default to 100%

if cols are not assigned numbers, it will automatically distribute
example:
col-sm  col-sm col-sm => automatically distribute to 4 each.

On a device smaller than 576px dimension, all col defaults to 100% of the width

On a single div, we can have multiple breakpoint:
col-sm-12 col-md-8 col-lg-4 
==> On a large device and above, take 4 out of 12 columns of the width
==> On medium device, take 8/12 of the width
==> On small device, take 12/12 of the width- Full width

Mix and Match sizes
col-2   col-4   col 
==> 2/12 4/12 adjust as appropriate
